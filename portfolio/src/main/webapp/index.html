      <h2>My Cat</h2> 

      <p>This is my WFH colleague, Chia. She is excited to be on board my intern experience. 
        She first became interested in coding when she ran across my keyboard. Unfortunately, the lines of code she typed did not compile.
        However, she is looking forward to learning a lot this summer!</p>
